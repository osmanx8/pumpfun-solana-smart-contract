# 💊 PumpX: A Solana Smart Contract Framework

**PumpX** is an advanced smart contract framework designed for token creators, market deployers, and liquidity engineers on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by platforms like pump.fun, it offers deeper control, more extensibility, and rich integration features with DeFi ecosystems like **Raydium** and **Meteora**.

Whether you're launching a memecoin or orchestrating an ecosystem, PumpX brings composable primitives, Discord alerts, CPI migrations, whitelisting systems, and real-time dashboards—out of the box.
